Dekho ye wale lecture mein we will learn to create models. To ye run nahi honge in this module we just have practised models.

We are here practising to create models for the creation of a todo app where each user is allowed to create a todo list inside each todo list we can have subtodo list as well. So we will create model for user, todo, subtodo

sabse pehle make models folder .

Now inside this models foldwer we will have  to create models .Think each model as an character.
So we first create user.models.js(this is only writing standard followed to write name for user model) Means todo k liye user to define hoga. And we will write the name of user model as user.model.js.

we will then create a new character todo.models.js

Then we will then create sub_todo_models.js

From here goto 01_user.model.js and you will learn everything.
